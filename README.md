# Twitter-sentiment-comparing-engine

What will this program do?
  
  We will build a sentiment comparison engine. We will be using TWEEPY library (that will allow us to download a sample of real time tweets mentioning our chosen keywords) and TEXTBLOB library (which uses Natural language processing to calculate the sentiments for our tweets) and Preprocessor library to clean up our tweets.

So, here the program is taking our 2 keywords Ronaldo and Messi as input.

Pre Req:
  
  Need a twitter developer account to access the real time tweet and to have the access to API key.
